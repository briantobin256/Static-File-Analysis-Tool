<p style='font-size:20px;color: blue;'>Description:</p>
<p style='font-size:16px;'>Packers are used to compress executable files. This can obfuscate the data making the file harder to analyse.</p>
<br>
<p style='font-size:18px;color: red;'>UPX</p>
<p style='font-size:16px'>This tool can detect if a file is packed using UPX, a common and free packer. It can also pack and unpack executable files using UPX.</p>
<br>
<p style='font-size:18px;color: red;'>Entropy</p>
<p style='font-size:16px;'>Entropy is a measurement of how random the data within a file is. High entropy in data is a characteristic of compression and encryption. This tool calculates
entropy of a file and gives a value of 0 - 8. This tool considers a total file entropy of 7 or more to be high.</p>
<br>
<p style='font-size:18px;color: red;'>Entropy Graph</p>
<p style='font-size:16px'>This tool also generates an entropy graph where the file is split into chunks and entropy is calculated for each individual chunk. This is useful where there are 
large chunks of low entropy data mixed with chunks of high entropy data, which may imply that there is some compression or encryption happening but the total file entropy is low. 
This tool considers a chunk entropy of 6 or more to be high (this is lower than total file entropy due to the logarithmic nature of Shannons entropy).</p>
<br>
<p style='font-size:20px;color: blue;'>Your Task:</p>
<p style='font-size:16px;'>To determine if the file is packed using UPX, and if so, unpack it. Once you are more familiar with this tool, you should pack files and and note the differences 
between packed and unpacked files using the other analysis techniques this tool provides.</p>
