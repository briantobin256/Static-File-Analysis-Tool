<p style='font-size:16px;'>Disassembly is the hardest part of static file analysis. It takes the raw bytes and turn them into assembly instruction. It is not very easy to read and you shouldnt 
really try to understand what every instruction is doing. The goal is to skim through the code and get an idea of what is happening without reading each instruction individually.</p>
