<p style='font-size:20px;color: blue;'>Description:</p>
<p style='font-size:16px;'>Dynamic Link Libraries are libraries of code that contain common functions. Different DLL's specialise in different types of functionality. Each imported DLL will 
have a list of imported functions.</p>
<br>
<p style='font-size:18px;color: red;'>Imported DLL's</p>
<p style='font-size:16px;'>The imported DLL's can give a hint of some general things that may be happening.<br>
Common DLL's to look out for:<br>
<b>KERNEL32</b> is the most common DLL that provides core Windows functionality.<br>
<b>ADVAPI32</b> gives access to more advanced Windows functionality such as accessing the registry.<br>
<b>NTDLL</b> is used to interface directly with the Windows kernel. Provides advanced functionality not normally available to programs such as manipulating running processes.<br>
<b>USER32</b> contains functions for interacting with user-interface components.<br>
<b>WININET</b> contains functions for high-level networking such as HTTP or FTP protocols.</p>
<br>
<p style='font-size:18px;color: red;'>Imported Functions</p>
<p style='font-size:16px;'>The imported functions can be very useful for finding out specific actions the file will perform. The function names are usually very self explanatory but a quick 
search on the internet can give even more information if needed.</p>
<br>
<p style='font-size:20px;color: blue;'>Your Task:</p>
<p style='font-size:16px;'>To look through the imported functions and note the ones that you find interesting. Come up with a hypthesis of what the file might do when executed based on 
these imported functions.</p>
<br>
<p style='font-size:20px;color: blue;'>Note:</p>
<p style='font-size:16px;'>The Import Directory Table contains relative pointers to the location of the imported DLL's. 
The Import Address Table contains relative pointers to the location of the imported functions.</p>
