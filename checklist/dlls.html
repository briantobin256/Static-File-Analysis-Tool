<p style='font-size:20px;color: blue;'>Description:</p>
<p style='font-size:16px;'>Dynamic Link Libraries are libraries of code that contain common functions. Different DLL's specialise in different types of functionality. Each imported DLL will 
have a list of imported functions.</p>
<br>
<p style='font-size:18px;color: red;'>Imported DLL's</p>
<p style='font-size:16px;'>The imported DLL's can give a hint of some general things that may be happening. For example, USER32.dll contains functions for interacting with user-interface 
components and WININET.dll contains functions for high-level networking such as HTTP or FTP protocols. The Import Directory Table contains relative pointers to the location of the imported DLL's.</p>
<br>
<p style='font-size:18px;color: red;'>Imported Functions</p>
<p style='font-size:16px;'>The imported functions can be very useful for finding out specific actions the file will perform. The function names are usually very self explanatory but a quick 
search on the internet can give even more information if needed. The Import Address Table contains relative pointers to the location of the imported functions.</p>
<br>
<p style='font-size:20px;color: blue;'>Your Task:</p>
<p style='font-size:16px;'>To look through the imported functions and come up with a hypothesis of what you think this file will do when executed.</p>
