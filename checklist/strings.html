<p style='font-size:20px;color: blue;'>Description:</p>
<p style='font-size:16px;'>Strings are defined by this tool as a sequence of 3 or more bytes that are human readable (characters between 32 and 126 on the ASCII table)
followed by a terminator (any non-readable character). They can give useful information about what the file is doing.<br><br>
Every string found in a file is displayed on the left. This brute-force approach to finding strings means that there will be a lot of false positives, but it is the best method available to us.</p>

<p style='font-size:20px;color: blue;'>Your Task:</p>
<p style='font-size:16px;'>To manually look through the list of strings and select any that stand out to you and might be useful. You can check strings by double clicking or right clicking
 and selecting check. This will add them to the saved strings section where you can view only the strings that you think may be useful.</p>
