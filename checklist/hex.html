<p style='font-size:20px;color: blue;'>Description:</p>
<p style='font-size:16px;'>This tool also provides a hex editor. It allows you to edit any of the bytes of a file. The leftmost column and the top row show the offset of a byte in the file. 
The middle column is the bytes in hexadecimal format. The right column is the bytes in text format if they can be represented by the basic ASCII chars.</p>
<p style='font-size:16px;'>This can be useful for you to understand how data is stored in a file. A file is simply a list of bytes which are just numbers.</p>
<p style='font-size:16px;'>If you go back to strings and right click one then select view in hex, you will be taken to the hex editor with the selected string starting somewhere in the first 
row on the screen.</p>
<p style='font-size:16px;'>The DLL page also has links to the location of the Import Directory Table and the Import Address Table.</p>

<p style='font-size:20px;color: blue;'>Your Task:</p>
<p style='font-size:16px;'>To become familiar with a hex editor. Scroll down to see if you can find strings in the decoded text section.</p>
<p style='font-size:16px;'>This will be used later during disassembly when you want to edit bytes to change some instructions.</p>
